Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
df[(df['Gold']-df['Gold.1'])==np.max(df['Gold']-df['Gold.1'])]

Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (Gold.2) counts for 3 points, silver medals (Silver.2) for 2 points, and bronze medals (Bronze.2) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.

df['Gold.2']*3+df['Silver.2']*2+df['Bronze.2']
